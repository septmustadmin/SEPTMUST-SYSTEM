          details, Be cautious with sharing personal information over the phone,

        <h3 style="color: lightblue;">3.1.1 Verify caller identity through known contact details:</h3>
        <p style="color: lightblue;">To prevent falling victim to vishing attacks, follow these steps: <br><br>
          Never provide personal or financial information to a caller without verifying their identity. Use known
          contact details obtained from official websites, statements, or the back of your credit or debit cards to
          reach out to the organization directly. Do not rely on contact information provided by the caller. <br><br>
          Be cautious even if the caller claims to be from a trusted organization. Attackers can spoof caller ID or
          mimic official greetings to appear legitimate. Verify their identity independently before sharing any
          sensitive information.</p><br><br>

        <h3 style="color: lightblue;">3.1.2 Be cautious with sharing personal information over the phone:</h3>
        <p style="color: lightblue;">
          Avoid sharing personal information like Social Security numbers, credit card details, passwords, or PINs over
          the phone unless you initiated the call or can independently verify the legitimacy of the caller. <br><br>
          Legitimate organizations usually have secure methods for verifying your identity, such as asking specific
          security questions or requesting information that is not highly sensitive.</p> <br><br>

        <h3 style="color: lightblue;">3.1.3 Recognize warning signs of a vishing attempt (e.g., urgency, threats):</h3>
        <p style="color: lightblue;">
          Be wary of callers who create a sense of urgency, pressure you to take immediate action, or threaten you with
          consequences if you don't comply. Legitimate organizations typically do not use such tactics. <br><br>
          Pay attention to inconsistencies in the caller's story or behavior. Scammers may make mistakes, exhibit
          unprofessionalism, or try to rush you into making a decision. <br><br>
          Trust your instincts. If something feels off or suspicious about the call, trust your gut and refrain from
          sharing sensitive information.</p><br><br>

        <h3 style="color: lightblue;">3.1.4 Avoid clicking on links or calling back unfamiliar numbers:</h3>
        <p style="color: lightblue;">
          Do not click on links or call back numbers provided by unknown callers, even if they claim it is for
          verification or security purposes. These links and numbers may lead to phishing websites or connect you to
          scammers. <br><br>
          If you receive a voicemail or missed call from an unknown number, do not call back without independently
          verifying the legitimacy of the caller.</p><br><br>

        <h3 style="color: lightblue;">3.1.4 Avoid clicking on links or calling back unfamiliar numbers:</h3>
        <p style="color: lightblue;">
          Report any vishing attempts or incidents to your local law enforcement agency, as well as the appropriate
          organizations that the scammer claimed to represent (e.g., your bank or the IRS). <br><br>
          If you receive suspicious calls, you can also report them to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United
          States or your country's equivalent regulatory body. <br><br>
          Sharing information about vishing attempts can help raise awareness and protect others from falling victim to
          similar scams. Consider reporting the incident to relevant online communities, forums, or social media
          platforms.</p><br><br>
